STATUS: beta, not working yeat, listing routes only on /routes
UPDATE: 21/04/2011 around 03:33

This project has a simply and small goal. 

The idea is you can create routes in your java application, this small library is inspired by
rails 3 routings model. You can route to Servlets, Jsp Pages and Statis resources like html and text.

Here is a sample:

public class MyRouter extends WebRouter {

	public Router define(){
		return Router.route()
				  
				  .from("/crud/people")
				  .toJsp("peoplecrud.jsp")
				  
				  .from("/crud/admin")
				  .toServlet("com.servlets.admin.AdminServlet")
				  
			   ;
	}
}
		
As you can you have a simple and nice DSL, this is from definition and execution BUT I don't do
registry, in other words you must hava register you servlets and jsp pages.

Configuration:

In your java web project(war) you just define the servlet:

	<servlet>
		<servlet-name>WebRouterServlet</servlet-name>
		<servlet-class>com.github.diegopacheco.webrouter.servlet.WebRouterServlet</servlet-class>
		<init-param>
			<param-name>router</param-name>
			<param-value>com.github.diegopacheco.webrouter.router.MyRouter</param-value>
		</init-param>
		<load-on-startup>1</load-on-startup>						
	</servlet>
	<servlet-mapping>
		<servlet-name>WebRouterServlet</servlet-name>
		<url-pattern>/*</url-pattern>		
	</servlet-mapping>
	
*router* is your router class showed above. So now you are ready to fun :-) 
You can see all avaliable routes just goto your browser and type http://localhost:8080/yourApplication/routes
